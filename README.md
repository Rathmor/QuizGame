# QuizGame
A quizgame that uses a file to read questions and answers from and has varying difficulty levels. Player progress is stored in a file after the quiz concludes.

Running in Linux: Open your terminal inside the folder of the program where file quizGame.c exists. 
                  Enter the command: gcc quizGame.c -o [filename] 
                  This will compile the C program into a runnable file
                  Enter the command: ./[filename] [name of the question and answer file] [difficulty (numbers 1-10)]
                  The quiz game will then commence
                             
Running in Windows: Open your command prompt in the folder of the program where file quizGame.c exists.
                    Enter the command gcc quizGame.c
                    This will compile the C program into a runnable file.
                    Enter the name of the .exe file that should have been created now (will be named the same name (E.G. quizGame.exe))
                    The quiz game will then commence
